# Once More, With Feeling: Measuring Emotion of Acting Performances in Contemporary American Film

Narrative film is a composition of writing, cinematography, editing, and
performance. While much computational work has focused on the writing or visual
style in film, we conduct in this paper a computational exploration of acting
performance. Applying speech emotion recognition models and a variationist
sociolinguistic analytical framework to a corpus of popular, contemporary
American film, we find narrative structure, diachronic shifts, and genre- and
dialogue-based constraints located in spoken performances.
